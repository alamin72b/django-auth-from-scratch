# 02 ‚Äì Manual Database Setup (No Django Models)

This chapter documents how I manually created a user database using **raw SQLite** ‚Äî without using Django‚Äôs ORM, models, or migrations.

I'm using Python‚Äôs built-in `sqlite3` module to control exactly how my database and table are created, stored, and queried.

---

## üéØ Goal

- Build the `users` table manually using SQL
- Skip Django models and migrations
- Control every part of the schema definition
- Store the database in a physical file (`auth.db`)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Creating the SQLite Database

I created a file called:

```

users/db.py

````

Inside it, I wrote:

```python
import sqlite3
from pathlib import Path

DB_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'auth.db'

def get_connection():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
    return conn
````

### üìå What this does:

* `DB_PATH` builds a **full path** to `auth.db` inside the `users/` folder.
* `get_connection()` opens a connection to the database file.

> This function returns a live database connection that I will use to read and write data later.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Creating the `users` Table

Still inside `db.py`, I wrote a function to create the table:

```python
def initialize_db():
    with get_connection() as conn:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("""
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
                created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
            )
        """)
        conn.commit()
```

### üìå What this does:

* Opens a connection
* Creates the `users` table if it doesn‚Äôt already exist
* Commits the change (saves it)
* Automatically closes the connection when done

---

## ‚ùì Q\&A: Doubts I Had and What I Learned

---

### ‚ùì What is `DB_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent / 'auth.db'` doing?

**Answer:**
This line builds the absolute path to the `auth.db` file.

Breakdown:

* `__file__` = path to the current file (`db.py`)
* `.resolve()` = converts to full absolute path
* `.parent` = gets the folder where the file is
* `/ 'auth.db'` = appends the filename

‚úÖ Final result: the database file will be saved in the same folder as `db.py`.

---

### ‚ùì Is the string inside `cur.execute(""" ... """)` a SQL query?

**Answer:**
Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs a raw SQL query.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  ...
)
```

This SQL command defines the structure of the `users` table. Django is not involved here ‚Äî I am writing directly in SQL.

---

### ‚ùì Why not just do this?

```python
get_connection().cursor().execute(...)
get_connection().commit()
get_connection().close()
```

**Answer:**
This doesn‚Äôt work because:

* Each call to `get_connection()` opens a **new, separate connection**
* You‚Äôre committing and closing different connections than the one that ran `.execute()`
* Your changes won‚Äôt be saved, and resources won‚Äôt be cleaned up

---

### ‚úÖ Correct usage:

```python
conn = get_connection()
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute(...)
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

Or use the safer version:

```python
with get_connection() as conn:
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(...)
    conn.commit()
```

---

### ‚ùì How often is `initialize_db()` called?

**Answer:**
Only once ‚Äî **per Django process startup**.

I called `initialize_db()` in `users/apps.py`:

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class UsersConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'users'

    def ready(self):
        from .db import initialize_db
        initialize_db()
```

This `ready()` method is called once when Django starts. It ensures the table is created early.

---

### ‚ùì What if I want to change the table later?

**Answer:**
Django‚Äôs migrations are off, so I manually manage schema changes.

For example, to add a new column:

```python
def add_column_if_not_exists():
    with get_connection() as conn:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        try:
            cur.execute("ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1")
            conn.commit()
        except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
            if "duplicate column name" in str(e).lower():
                print("Column already exists. Skipping.")
            else:
                raise
```

This function safely tries to add a column and handles the case where it already exists.

## ‚úÖ Summary

* I now have a fully manual user database setup with raw SQL and Python.
* No Django models, no migrations, no shortcuts.
* I can evolve the database manually using SQL and versioned upgrade functions.

---

## üîú Next Up

I will write logic to **register a new user**:

* Take username, email, and password
* Hash the password using `bcrypt`
* Store the user in this raw SQL table
